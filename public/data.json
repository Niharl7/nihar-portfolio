      "Cloud-native, ML-curious, full-stack builder who can’t resist a good side project. Most days you’ll catch me architecting resilient Java/Spring microservices and polishing React front-ends so users never feel the plumbing underneath.",
      "I love turning rough ideas into reliable, scalable software—shipped fast, tested well, and ready to evolve. If something breaks, I fix it, document it, and share the lesson.",
      "Away from the keyboard, you’ll find me reading, buried in movies or hunting for the perfect espresso.",
      "Got an idea that needs scalable backends, machine-learning smarts, or just an extra set of curious eyes? Let’s connect and build something great together."
